description: Repo-local VPK-rovo component refactoring and placement guidance. Use when the user asks to tidy or refactor a VPK React component, split an overgrown component under app or components, move VPK UI logic into hooks or data files, make a VPK component easier to reuse without changing behavior, remove stale shared buckets, or verify VPK route/accessibility impact after cleanup. Do not use for generic behavior-preserving simplification outside VPK UI; prefer the global code-simplification skill for that.
purpose: Keep VPK React component refactors behavior-preserving, locally owned, and aligned with repo placement, token, accessibility, and validation rules.
owner: VPK
category: component-architecture
inputs: Target component or route, current callsites, nearby primitives, route impact, and validation requirements.
outputs: Focused component, hook, data, or import cleanup with validation evidence and route-impact notes.
required_tools: shell, rg, pnpm, browser verification tools for UI changes
validation_command: pnpm run lint && pnpm run typecheck
generated_artifacts: none by default; approved refactors may create colocated component, hook, data, or test files.
common_failure_modes: Moving behavior into vague shared buckets, changing public props unnecessarily, missing route callsites, or skipping UI verification after rendered changes.

# VPK Tidy

Refactor VPK-rovo React component surfaces without losing repo conventions,
route behavior, or ownership clarity. This skill is a repo-local router and
checklist; use broader system skills for generic React theory.

## Boundary

Use this skill for:

- VPK components under `app/**`, `components/**`, or VPK route demos.
- Removing stale shared buckets or preventing new vague shared folders.
- Splitting oversized VPK components into local `components/`, `hooks/`, or
  `data/` files.
- Moving static route/component data out of JSX.
- Confirming VPK validation, browser, and ADS accessibility checks after UI
  cleanup.

Do not use this skill as the primary guide for:

- Generic behavior-preserving code cleanup with no VPK UI surface; use
  `code-simplification`.
- Designing a new reusable component API from scratch; use
  `building-components` or `vercel-composition-patterns`, then apply this
  skill for VPK placement and validation.
- Pure Next.js routing, RSC, image, font, or metadata work; use
  `next-best-practices`.
- shadcn registry install/update workflows; use `shadcn`, then apply this
  skill only for VPK integration.

## Related Skills

| Need | Prefer | How `vpk-tidy` adds value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generic readability cleanup | `code-simplification` | Adds VPK placement, route, and ADS verification gates |
| Component API design | `building-components`, `vercel-composition-patterns` | Keeps the final API aligned with VPK folders and imports |
| React/Next performance | `vercel-react-best-practices`, `next-best-practices` | Applies only the VPK-visible cleanup safely |
| shadcn primitive usage | `shadcn` | Ensures direct primitives replace local wrappers correctly |
| Behavior changes or bug fixes | `test-driven-development` | Keeps tests tied to VPK validation commands |

## Quick Rules

| Rule | Threshold | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Component size | Over 150 lines or mixed responsibilities | Split into local sub-components |
| Business logic | Event flows, async state, derived decisions | Move to a custom hook near the feature |
| Static data | Lists, URLs, menu items, config, copy maps | Move to a local `data/` file |
| Public props | Exported/reused component | Use `Readonly<ComponentNameProps>` |
| UI changes | Any rendered route impact | Browser smoke + ADS accessibility checks |

## VPK Placement

| Location | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| `components/ui/` | Shared primitive used by multiple features, no feature logic |
| `components/ui-custom/` | VPK-specific reusable component used across unrelated surfaces |
| `components/projects/shared/` | Shared project/runtime component or utility used by multiple project surfaces |
| `components/blocks/[feature]/components/` | Feature-specific block sub-component |
| `components/blocks/[feature]/hooks/` | Feature-specific state or business logic |
| `components/blocks/[feature]/data/` | Feature-specific static data |
| `components/website/demos/utils/` | Utility/control-surface demo for the component catalog |
| Existing route/demo folder | Route-local cleanup that should not become shared |

Prefer `@/` imports when the alias applies. Preserve tabs in TS/JS files. Use
`cn()` for class merging. Use `cva()` only where the surrounding UI primitive
already uses variant styling or the component genuinely needs variants.

## Retired Shared Buckets

`components/blocks/shared/*` and `components/blocks/shared-ui/*` are retired.
Do not add new components, demos, data, styles, utilities, or re-export shims
there.

Use these gates whenever you find a stale import from a retired shared bucket or
when moving a shared component to a clearer owner.

### 1. Inventory every reference

```bash
rg -n "@/components/blocks/shared(?:-ui)?|components/blocks/shared(?:-ui)?" app components
```

### 2. Choose the explicit owner before edits

| Old shape | New owner |
| --- | --- |
| Shared primitive with no feature logic | `components/ui/` |
| VPK-specific reusable UI | `components/ui-custom/` |
| Shared Rovo/project runtime surface | `components/projects/shared/` |
| Shared non-visual utility | `lib/` |
| Block-specific sub-component | `components/blocks/[feature]/components/` |
| Catalog utility/control demo | `components/website/demos/utils/` |

Map old imports, exported names, removed props, renamed props, type
substitutions, and behavior differences. Do not delete old files before every
callsite compiles.

### 3. Migrate callsites first

- Update imports and callsites.
- Run the affected typecheck/lint path.
- Delete old files only after callsites compile.
- If interaction behavior changed, smoke-test every impacted route.

### 4. Prove no retired bucket remains

```bash
rg -n "@/components/blocks/shared(?:-ui)?|components/blocks/shared(?:-ui)?" app components
test ! -d components/blocks/shared
test ! -d components/blocks/shared-ui
```

Expected result: no stale imports and no `components/blocks/shared` or
`components/blocks/shared-ui` directory.

## Refactor Workflow

1. Confirm the exact target file, route, and current git status.
2. Read the target component and nearby files before editing.
3. Search for existing VPK primitives or sibling patterns before creating new
   files.
4. If ownership is changing, complete the retired shared bucket gates.
5. Make the smallest behavior-preserving structural change that solves the
   tidy request.
6. Validate with repo commands and route evidence.

## Structural Rules

- Split components only when it removes real mixed responsibility or makes a
  route surface easier to review.
- Keep feature-specific pieces near the feature; do not promote to
  `components/ui/` until at least two real callsites need the primitive.
- Move event handlers and async/business logic into custom hooks when the JSX
  is no longer easy to scan.
- Move static data to `data/` files only when it is reused, long, or obscures
  the rendered structure.
- Preserve existing public prop names and behavior unless the user explicitly
  asked for an API change.
- Use React 19 patterns from `AGENTS.md`: `use(Context)`, `<Context value={}>`,
  and `ref` as a normal prop.
- Render conditionally with ternaries (`cond ? <X /> : null`) instead of `&&`
  when the condition may be numeric.

## Type Rules

For exported or reused components:

```tsx
export interface CardProps extends React.ComponentProps<"div"> {
	title: string;
	variant?: "default" | "elevated" | "outlined";
}

export function Card({ title, variant = "default", className, ...props }: Readonly<CardProps>) {
	return <div className={cn("...", className)} {...props}>{title}</div>;
}
```

- Name interfaces `[ComponentName]Props`.
- Export prop interfaces for exported components.
- Use discriminated unions for variant-like props.
- Extend `React.ComponentProps<"element">` when wrapping a DOM element.
- Spread props last when user overrides should win.

## Accessibility Checks

During refactors, fix obvious regressions in touched UI:

| If you find | Replace or add |
| --- | --- |
| `<div onClick>` | `<button>` or an appropriate semantic element |
| Icon-only button | `aria-label` describing the action |
| Form field without label | Associated `<label>` or `aria-labelledby` |
| Dialog/modal | Focus handling, Escape behavior, dialog semantics |
| Dynamic status update | `aria-live="polite"` where useful |

Use `references/accessibility.md` only when the touched component needs focus,
ARIA, or data-attribute examples.

## Validation

Always run:

```bash
pnpm run lint
pnpm run typecheck
```

If repo-wide lint fails because of unrelated baseline issues, also run:

```bash
pnpm exec eslint <changed-file-1> <changed-file-2> ...
```

For UI changes:

- Verify affected route(s) in browser snapshots, light and dark when feasible.
- Run `ads_analyze_a11y` on changed components when available.
- Run `ads_analyze_localhost_a11y` on affected routes or scoped selectors.
- Classify findings as introduced regressions vs. unrelated page-shell,
  tooling, or pre-existing issues.

## References

- `references/patterns.md`: local examples for composition, hooks, and
  simplification. Prefer global `building-components`,
  `vercel-composition-patterns`, and `code-simplification` for broad theory.
- `references/accessibility.md`: local accessibility examples for component
  refactors.
