# Rovo Core

`rovo-core` owns behavior that is shared by the `/rovo` and `/studio` app
surfaces. Route adapters and route hooks keep product-specific policy at the
edge so shared code does not grow route conditionals.

## Route Behavior Matrix

| Behavior | `/rovo` | `/studio` | Current owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Route root | `/rovo` | `/studio` | `rovo-app-adapter.ts` and `studio-app-adapter.ts` |
| Queue provider | Thin route re-export of shared queue context | Thin route re-export of shared queue context | `rovo-core/hooks/use-rovo-app-queue.tsx` |
| Queue processing | Shared idle wait, peek/gate/shift/dispatch loop, active dispatch flag, re-prepend, and send-settle retry | Same shared loop with a Studio-owned immediate-dispatch pause callback before queue shift | `rovo-core/lib/rovo-app-queue-state.ts` plus route callbacks |
| Thread list refresh | Shared focus/visibility refresh, optimistic deletion, and 15s passive refresh option | Same shared lifecycle with serialized no-op refresh suppression and no passive interval | `rovo-core/hooks/use-rovo-app-thread-list.ts` |

| Chat request body | Plain Rovo app body; no Studio source flag; no creation mode passthrough | Adds `chatSdkSource: "studio"` and allows validated `creationMode` | `rovo-core/lib/rovo-app-hook-helpers.ts`, `rovo-core/lib/rovo-app-route-adapter.ts`, and route adapters |
| Creation mode | Not exposed by the public hook contract | Supports `agent` and `skill` creation continuation metadata | Studio route hook, shared payload helpers |
| Send mode | Queue-first behavior | Queue or immediate mode, with immediate interruption side effects | Studio route hook, shared dispatch resolvers |
| Clarification continuations | Shared answer, dismiss, and deferred-dismiss wait/send lifecycle; plan-mode deferred tool answers can resume planning | Same shared lifecycle with Studio-owned creation metadata, submit callback, and send-failure rollback | `rovo-core/lib/rovo-app-clarification-lifecycle.ts` plus route callbacks |
| Plan review lifecycle | Shared accept/revise payload construction, deferred-tool resume body, planning-session restart, dismissed tracker reset, and local user-message dispatch | Same shared lifecycle; Studio does not add creation-mode policy to plan review turns | `rovo-core/lib/rovo-app-plan-review-lifecycle.ts` plus route callbacks |

| Active run lifecycle | Shared local active-run records, attached-run chunk promotion, useChat finish/error cleanup, completed-turn release wait, explicit cancel debounce/fallback, thread-run cancellation, active-turn interruption, and interrupted-message marking | Same shared lifecycle; Studio creation/send policy and interrupt ref bridge stay route-local | `rovo-core/lib/rovo-app-run-lifecycle.ts` |
| Panel behavior | Shared panel state shape, artifact open/save/delete/hide dispatch, active selection persistence, and streaming/completed auto-open decisions | Same panel lifecycle and auto-open decisions | `rovo-core/lib/rovo-app-artifact-panel-dispatcher.ts` |

| Realtime message append/persist | Shared realtime message creation, local merge, thread record update, and persistence bridge | Same shared bridge; Studio can pass custom realtime parts for route-owned result cards | `rovo-core/lib/rovo-app-realtime-message-state.ts` plus route callbacks |
| Message display policy | Shared assistant text sanitization, widget visibility, action visibility, and blank-message suppression | Same shared policy; Studio adds an automation artifact-list parser/widget as a route-owned tool-driven widget | `rovo-core/lib/rovo-app-message-display.ts`, `studio/lib/studio-automation-artifact-list.ts`, `studio/components/studio-automation-artifact-list-widget.tsx`, and Studio message/shell registration |

| Clicky voice bridge | Shared activation, Realtime connection, and one-time initial-context injection lifecycle; route wrapper owns the Rovo prompt | Same shared lifecycle; Studio wrapper appends live product knowledge from the agent catalog at injection time | `rovo-core/hooks/use-clicky-voice.ts` plus route prompt wrappers |
| Prompt/delegation dispatch lifecycle | Shared text normalization, thread resolution, queue decision, enqueue/kick lifecycle, prompt send execution, streaming-artifact interruption, optimistic rollback, and direct delegation handoff | Same shared lifecycle with Studio-owned immediate interruption callbacks, queued-action acceleration, and creation-mode/send-mode inputs | `rovo-core/lib/rovo-app-dispatch.ts`, `rovo-app-dispatch-lifecycle.ts`, `rovo-app-delegation-dispatcher.ts`, and route callbacks |

## Extraction Boundary

- Shared core may own pure normalization, state transitions, callback-driven
  lifecycle bridges, queue decisions, payload builders, route adapters, API
  helpers, and streaming parsers.
- `use-rovo-app-core` owns the shared hook body. Route hooks should stay thin:
  they supply queue context, route adapters, clarification policy, send-mode
  state, and route-specific side-effect callbacks without adding shared control
  flow back into `/rovo` or `/studio`.
- Route shells remain product-specific. Share pure layout helpers and focused
  primitives in `rovo-core`, but do not merge the Rovo and Studio shells.
