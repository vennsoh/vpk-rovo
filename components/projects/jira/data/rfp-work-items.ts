Split Northstar Bank requirements into functional answers, legal or security exhibits, pricing files, implementation plans, customer-reference requests, and demo follow-ups. Flag ambiguous language early so the account team can submit clarification questions before the deadline instead of discovering gaps during final review.",

Assign drivers, approvers, contributors, and informed stakeholders across account leadership, proposal management, sales engineering, product specialists, legal, security, deal desk, support, and partner teams. The goal is to make every Meridian Health decision area visibly owned, reduce duplicate drafting, and ensure the bid/no-bid recommendation has an escalation path for blocked answers or risky commitments.",

Cover ITSM, incident, problem, change, request, Assets and CMDB, hardware and software asset management, knowledge, reporting, portal management, AI, integrations, customer service, HR services, data residency, legal compliance, GRC, risk, vulnerability management, implementation services, and pricing. Mark which HelioWorks Energy topics are core Atlassian strengths, which need partner positioning, and which need careful expectation setting.",

Check mandatory requirements, certification asks, residency constraints, asset-management depth, security operations expectations, migration timelines, pricing guardrails, reference requirements, and executive-demo readiness. Summarize the BluePeak Telecom risks as concrete mitigation actions so leadership can decide whether to proceed, qualify the response, or request additional customer clarification.",
	"RFP-106": "Build a Redwood Retail Group response calendar that includes supplier questions, internal draft checkpoints, qualification reviews, legal and security approvals, pricing sign-off, final executive review, submission packaging, and post-submission follow-ups. Include buffer for missing evidence and late-stage scope changes. The timeline should be practical enough for the response team to work from and clear enough for leadership to understand where slippage will create Redwood Retail Group deal risk.",

Capture the current tools, known pain points, business outcomes, executive priorities, implementation constraints, success metrics, user populations, regional differences, support model, and likely competitor strengths. Convert that Summit Grove Insurance context into qualification evidence and reusable win themes that can shape the decision brief if the pursuit proceeds.",

Connect Jira Service Management, Jira, Confluence, Assets, Rovo, Teamwork Graph, Guard, analytics, automation, and marketplace extensibility into one coherent system-of-work story. The draft should explain how Atlassian could reduce Orion Motors tool sprawl, improve service delivery, give leaders visibility, and create a phased path from today's environment to a more connected operating model.",

Show how NimbusCare could design intake channels, route work to the right teams, manage SLAs, publish knowledge from Confluence, report on operational performance, and connect service work to software delivery. Include demo moments, configuration assumptions, known limitations, and reusable answer snippets the proposal team can paste into the formal response matrix.",

Cover licensing assumptions, phased rollout options, implementation services, migration support, training, success planning, total cost of ownership, renewal considerations, and any discount or approval dependencies. The work should give deal desk enough Copperline Logistics-specific detail to approve the numbers and give the customer a credible view of how Atlassian can be adopted without a disruptive big-bang migration.",

Validate where Atlassian can answer directly, where data import or discovery assumptions matter, and where a partner or roadmap explanation is the most honest answer. The review should produce precise VertexRail language that is confident, accurate, and demoable without overstating native capabilities.",
	"RFP-162": "Review Greenfield BioSystems data residency, DPA, legal terms, procurement conditions, privacy requirements, and contract language for the response. Identify clauses that need legal approval, standard positions that can be reused, and Greenfield BioSystems-specific asks that may require exceptions. The output should give the proposal manager clear approved wording and a list of open legal risks that must be resolved before submission.",

Confirm the current evidence package, approved product language, and any integration-based positioning for requirements outside native JSM workflows. The goal is to make the HarborPoint Finance response strong enough for a security evaluator while avoiding commitments that product, legal, or support teams cannot stand behind.",
	"RFP-164": "Prepare the Silverline Manufacturing executive review package for the final pitch. Summarize the customer problem, Atlassian win themes, major differentiators, known gaps, pricing posture, implementation approach, and demo storyline. The review should help leadership decide whether the Silverline Manufacturing response is compelling, whether the deal strategy is realistic, and which messages need to be emphasized in the final customer conversation.",
	"RFP-181": "Package and submit the TidalWorks Utilities clarification responses that unblock the proposal team. Make sure every customer question has an owner-approved answer, every answer is consistent with the main qualification strategy, and any new TidalWorks Utilities requirement discovered through Q&A is routed back into the board. Capture the submission timestamp and any follow-up commitments so the team can prove what was sent and when.",
	"RFP-182": "Archive the Novacore University final response package, exhibits, pricing files, demo deck, approved legal language, security artifacts, and reusable answer snippets. Tag the materials by requirement area so future RFP teams can find them quickly.
